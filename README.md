Hi! My name is Pius, from Uganda 🇺🇬.  I'm a full-stack software engineer who specializes in using JavaScript, React, Redux, and Rails to build software solutions for small and medium businesses. I am passionate ❤️ about growing teams because we can grow faster when the entire team grows, and pivot to embrace new skills.
